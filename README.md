### Project Overview
-------------------
This Class project; titled "Incubator Hub HR Data Analysis Tracker" aimed to generate insight into the attrition rate

### Data Sources
----------------
[HR Data.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17624020/HR.Data.xlsx)


### Tools Used
--------------

- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](http://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Data Visualization

- Power BI
  - For Data Entry/Get Data from Open Sources
  - For Data Transformation
  - For Data Visualization
 
- GitHub
  - For Portfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
-----------------------------------
- In the initial phase of the Data Cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions:
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling missing variables
  3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
-----------------------------
- EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as:
  1. What is the Attrition Rate to Total Number Of Employee?
  2. What is the Attrition Rate by Department?
  3. What is the Attrition Rate by Educational Field?
  4. What is the Attrition Rate by Gender?
  5. What is the Attrition Rate by Age Group
  

### Data Analysis
-----------------
- This is where we included some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during the analysis.
   - Example 1:
   ~~~Power BI
   Attrition Rate = Sum('HR data'[Attrition Count])/sum('HR data'[Employee Count])
   ~~~

 - Example 2:
 ~~~Power BI
 Average Age = Sum('HR data'[Age])/sum('HR data'[Employee Count])
 ~~~

### Key Insights
----------------
- Total Number of Attrition count = 237 (i.e. 16%):
- By Deparment, 133 from R&D;
- By Education Field, 89 from Life Sciences;
- By Gender, 150 males; and
- By Age Band, 112 between 25-34
